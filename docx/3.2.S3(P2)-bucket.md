# Bucket
- Để lưu trữ dữ liệu trên S3, bạn cần tạo bucket và upload object lên bucket.
- Amazon S3 cung cấp API cho bạn quản lý các bucket và object. For example, you can create a bucket and upload objects using the Amazon S3 API. You can also use the Amazon S3 console to perform these operations. The console uses the Amazon S3 APIs to send requests to Amazon S3.
- Amazon S3 hỗ trợ global buckets, t ức là mỗi bucket name phải là duy nhất trên tất cả các AWS account trong tất cả các Region với một partition. Một partition là một nhóm của Region. AWS currently has three partitions: aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China Regions), and aws-us-gov (AWS GovCloud (US)).

# Managing public access to buckets
- Cung cấp các cài đặt cho access point, bucket, và account để quản lý việc truy cập từ public internet vào S3 resource. Mặc định thì các bucket mới, access point và object không cho phép public access.

# Bucket configuration options
- Amazon S3 cung cấp nhiều lựa chọn cho phép cấu hình các bucket như: website hosting, thêm cấu hình quản lý lifecycle object trong bucket, config log all access tới bucket.
- Amazon S3 cung cấp một vài subresource để lưu trữ và quản lý thông tin cấu hính bucket.

| Subresource                              | Description                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| _cors_ (cross-origin resource sharing)   | You can configure your bucket to allow cross-origin requests. For more information, see [Using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html).  |
| _event notification_                     | You can enable your bucket to send you notifications of specified bucket events. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html).   |
| _lifecycle_                              | You can define lifecycle rules for objects in your bucket that have a well-defined lifecycle. For example, you can define a rule to archive objects one year after creation, or delete an object 10 years after creation. For more information, see [Managing your storage lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html).  |
| _location_                               | When you create a bucket, you specify the AWS Region where you want Amazon S3 to create the bucket. Amazon S3 stores this information in the location subresource and provides an API for you to retrieve this information.  |
| _logging_                                | Logging enables you to track requests for access to your bucket. Each access log record provides details about a single access request, such as the requester, bucket name, request time, request action, response status, and error code, if any. Access log information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill. For more information, see [Logging requests using server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html). |
| _object locking_                         | To use S3 Object Lock, you must enable it for a bucket. You can also optionally configure a default retention mode and period that applies to new objects that are placed in the bucket. For more information, see [Bucket configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html#object-lock-bucket-config).       |
| _policy_ and _ACL_ (access control list) | All your resources (such as buckets and objects) are private by default. Amazon S3 supports both bucket policy and access control list (ACL) options for you to grant and manage bucket-level permissions. Amazon S3 stores the permission information in the _policy_ and _acl_ subresources. For more information, see [Identity and access management in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).   |
| _replication_                            | Replication is the automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different or the same AWS Regions. For more information, see [Replicating objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html).  |
| _requestPayment_                         | By default, the AWS account that creates the bucket (the bucket owner) pays for downloads from the bucket. Using this subresource, the bucket owner can specify that the person requesting the download will be charged for the download. Amazon S3 provides an API for you to manage this subresource. For more information, see [Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.html).   |
| _tagging_                                | You can add cost allocation tags to your bucket to categorize and track your AWS costs. Amazon S3 provides the _tagging_ subresource to store and manage tags on a bucket. Using tags you apply to your bucket, AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by your tags. For more information, see [Billing and usage reporting for S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/BucketBilling.html).   |
| _transfer acceleration_                  | Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of the globally distributed edge locations of Amazon CloudFront. For more information, see [Configuring fast, secure file transfers using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html).  |
| _versioning_                             | Versioning helps you recover accidental overwrites and deletes. We recommend versioning as a best practice to recover objects from being deleted or overwritten by mistake. For more information, see [Using versioning in S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html).  |
| _website_                                | You can configure your bucket for static website hosting. Amazon S3 stores this configuration by creating a _website_ subresource. For more information, see [Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html). |
